Shi_CSCI2270_FinalProject

This project is about building up a map application based on CU Boulder and find the shortest path for student.

First the campus map would be build-in and the function would read the map first.

Second the user is asked to input the start point and end point.

Then the function would give awsner to the user based on the time cost and distance cost.
